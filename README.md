# Skedaddle
**With the intention of exploring JavaFX capabilities, on February 2019, I started a side project that turned into this Skedaddle game. Further development is planned.**



<br>

## Current Features 
#### Skedaddle - at the moment - supports 2 gameplay modes:

**Both modes offer the following options:**
- Start a new game.
- Select the number of tiles per row - between 2 & 18. 
- Shuffle without increasing your moves' count.
- Peek - get a preview of the puzzle's solution.
- Exit game.
<br>

**Normal Mode:**
- Numbered tiles (in ascending order) with solid background.

**Picture Mode:**
- Upload a picture.
- Use default picture.
<br>

**Future releases will include:**
- Incorporation of timer to various game modes.
- A game mode that replaces the tile's numbers with letters (in natural order). or symbols. Which adds the challenge of memorizing the initial places.
- Support for levels and different difficulties.
- A game mode that:
  - Offers puzzles that aren't ordered in natural order.
  - Offers levels that mix the board with different types of tiles.
- Support for powerups.<br>For instance:<br>
  - Get 1 tile to its correct position - while maintaining puzzle's solvability.
  - Get x seconds of "Peek" feature.
  - Convert a selected tile to an empty space.
